<p>OpenGL is the first programming utility that I use during my days of programming and doing tasks. At first it is confusing in many ways (because I am a confused person). It works with C and most of C's friends, one of them that I like to use is C++.</p>
<p>Just a heads up, this is usually just for testing or for fun. If you want to make a serious or complete game, I suggest searching for guides deeper in <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> or other websites for more advanced tutorials.</p>
<p>First things first, I will explain on how some things work in C++. If you don't have it, I suggest downloading it by using <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started">MinGW</a> for Windows. On Linux, use the usual</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo apt-get install g++</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will also need <a href="http://www.glfw.org/download.html">GLFW</a>, although you're free to use other OpenGL utilities as well.</p>
<p>Once they have been downloaded, you will needa basic concept of object-oriented programming (or just explore C++ for yourself). There are many ways to represent a shooter game, so it is encouraged for you to find your own style afterwards.</p>

<p>First of all, get started with GLFW <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html">here</a>. Put those codes in the main program <span style="color: #00ff00;">int main()</span>. You will need at least these codes in the body:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>the glfwInit</li>
<li>a glfwWindow (using glfwCreateWindow)</li>
<li>select the window with glfwMakeContextCurrent</li>
<li>a way of input, either with <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html#input_keyboard">Keyboard</a> or <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html#input_mouse">Mouse</a></li>
<li>set a swap buffer of 1 with <span style="color: #00ff00;">glfwSwapInterval(1);</span></li>
<li>the main drawing code: <span style="color: #00ff00;">while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(yourWindowName)) { }<br /></span></li>
<li>before the end braces of the above code, add <span style="color: #00ff00;">glfwSwapBuffers(window);</span> and <span style="color: #00ff00;">glfwPollEvents();</span></li>
<li>glfwDestroyWindow() and glfwTerminate() at the end</li>
<li>(optional) a way to use time (glfwGetTime() usage)</li>
</ul>
<p>For basics: the initialisation codes will go before the while (!glfwWindowShouldClose()) loop, the drawing and animation goes inside the loop.</p>
<h2>Drawing shapes in OpenGL</h2>
<p>If you're fond of more advances features (which will probably be more useful than this), I highly suggest reading the well-documented <a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-2-the-first-triangle/">OpenGL Tutorial</a> here.</p>
<p>Drawing in OpenGL in its simplest way uses glBegin(shape_type), glVertex2f(pointx, pointy), glEnd(). Use GL_TRIANGLES for triangles, GL_SQUARES for squares, GL_POLYGON for a convex shape, GL_LINE_LOOP to make the shape outline only. For squres and triangles, make sure to have 3 and 4 points or glVertex2f codes respectively. The window acts like a Cartesian grid, with point (0,0) being at the center, positive x-axis to the right and positive y-axis upwards.</p>
